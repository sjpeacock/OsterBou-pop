Spatiotemporal modelling of climate-change effects on an Arctic
host-parasite system

##### “OsterBou”= Ostertagia + cariBou

##### “pop” = population dynamics

This repository contains R code for:

1.  analysing a lab experiment looking at the temperature-sensitivity of
    development and mortality of free-living larvae from the parasitic
    nematode, Ostertagia gruehneri (in `dataAnalysis`); and

2.  simulating a migratory host-parasite model (Peacock et
    al. 2018, 2020) tailored to barren-ground caribou and Ostertagia
    `simulations`.

The folder `parameterization` contains little snippits of code and
figures exploring functions for parameters in the simulations other than
the free-living larvae mortality and development described in (1).
